## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Prompts**

### 1. System Architecture Design
**Prompt:** "Design a system architecture diagram for a project management platform using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The diagram should illustrate major components (frontend, backend, database), flow between user actions, REST API endpoints, authentication, and auxiliary systems (notifications, file storage, real-time updates)."

**Use Case:** Initial system design and planning
**Output:** Comprehensive architecture diagram with component relationships

### 2. Entity Relationship Diagram
**Prompt:** "Create a detailed entity-relationship (ER) diagram and table schemas for the following entities: Projects, Milestones, Tasks, Users, Comments, Attachments, Roles, TimeLogs. Specify primary and foreign keys, relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), and data types for each field. Document how entities like time tracking, attachments, and user roles relate to their parent objects."

**Use Case:** Database design and schema planning
**Output:** Complete ER diagram with table schemas and relationships

### 3. Database Schema Creation
**Prompt:** "Create database scheme for following tables: Projects Table, Milestones Table, Tasks Table, Users, Comments, Attachments, Roles, TimeLogs. Support for pgadmin4"

**Use Case:** Database implementation
**Output:** PostgreSQL schema with proper constraints and relationships

## üìã **Development Planning Prompts**

### 4. Development Plan Creation
**Prompt:** "Draft a development plan for the project management system, breaking the work into clear phases: database design, backend/API implementation, frontend UI, testing, deployment, documentation. For each phase, estimate time allocation (hours/days/week), list major deliverables, assign responsible team members, and add milestone check-ins."

**Use Case:** Project planning and resource allocation
**Output:** Detailed development timeline with phases, deliverables, and team assignments

### 5. Project Structure Organization
**Prompt:** "Isolate both front end and Back end code in different folders"

**Use Case:** Code organization and separation of concerns
**Output:** Clear folder structure with frontend/backend separation

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Development Prompts**

### 6. Database Schema Design
**Prompt:** "Design a PostgreSQL database table to store project information, including project name, description, created by, start and end dates, and status. Each project should support multiple milestones and be linked to a team."

**Use Case:** Core entity design
**Output:** Project table schema with relationships

### 7. Milestone Table Design
**Prompt:** "Create a table structure for project milestones. Each milestone should be linked to a project, have a name, description, due date, and completion status."

**Use Case:** Milestone entity design
**Output:** Milestone table schema with project relationships

### 8. Task Management Design
**Prompt:** "Design a tasks table to support task assignment to team members. Fields should include task title, description, priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High), due date, status, assigned user, parent milestone, and progress indicators."

**Use Case:** Task entity design
**Output:** Task table schema with assignment and progress tracking

### 9. User and Role Management
**Prompt:** "Devise tables for users/teammates and their roles (e.g., admin, manager, member). Users should be associated with projects and tasks."

**Use Case:** User management and role-based access control
**Output:** User and role table schemas with relationships

### 10. Content Management Design
**Prompt:** "Define tables for task comments and file attachments. Each comment should reference a task and user, include timestamp and content. Attachments should store the file path, associated task/comment, and uploader."

**Use Case:** Content and file management
**Output:** Comment and attachment table schemas

### 11. Time Tracking Design
**Prompt:** "Create a time tracking table to log hours spent by each user on a given task or project, including start/end timestamps, total hours, notes, and references to user and task/project."

**Use Case:** Time tracking and billing
**Output:** Time log table schema with user and project relationships

### 12. Database Connectivity and Seeding
**Prompt:** "Create database connectivity and add a seed data"

**Use Case:** Database setup and testing data
**Output:** Database connection configuration and comprehensive seed data

## üìù **Effective Prompt Writing Guidelines**

### **1. Be Specific and Detailed**
**Good:** "Design a PostgreSQL database table to store project information, including project name, description, created by, start and end dates, and status. Each project should support multiple milestones and be linked to a team."

**Poor:** "Create a project table"

### **2. Include Context and Requirements**
**Good:** "Create a detailed entity-relationship (ER) diagram and table schemas for the following entities: Projects, Milestones, Tasks, Users, Comments, Attachments, Roles, TimeLogs. Specify primary and foreign keys, relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), and data types for each field."

**Poor:** "Make an ER diagram"

### **3. Specify Output Format**
**Good:** "The diagram should illustrate major components (frontend, backend, database), flow between user actions, REST API endpoints, authentication, and auxiliary systems (notifications, file storage, real-time updates)."

**Poor:** "Show the architecture"

### **4. Include Technical Constraints**
**Good:** "Support for pgadmin4"

**Poor:** "Use a database"
